## User Story

* AS A user who is interested in signing up with a meal delivery service and comparing all of my options,
* I WANT a service that offers a great variety of international recipe choices that all come with nutritional data,
* AND THEN be able to save recipes, ingredients, meal selections to my profile and/or my cart.

## Description

Our project is an e-commerce app called International Ingredients to Wordly Meals. It is for an international meal prep company, where customers can shop for international meals. The meal kits come with all the ingredients needed to prepare the desired meal. What sets our company apart is the great variety of international recipe choices that all come with nutritional data that the customer can use to fit into their own diets and lifestyles.
