## User Story

* AS A health-conscious consumer who enjoys cooking,
* I WANT a convenient, large international variety of quick and easy meal prep options with nutritional facts,
* AND THEN I can pick up each meal kit which includes all the necessary ingredients to cook each meal.

## Description

Our project is an e-commerce app called International Ingredients to Wordly Meals. "Worldly Meals" for short. It’s a meal prep company, where customers can shop and pick up ingredients to cook international meals. The meal kits come with all the ingredients needed to prepare the desired meal. What sets our company apart? We offer a great variety of international recipe choices that all come with nutritional data that the customer can use to fit into their own diets and lifestyles.

## API

Wordly Meals utilizes Edamam&#8212;a robust app that offers a variety of API's broken down by 3 main topics: food, nutrition and recipes. From there, you will find more API's within each one of those 3 main topics. It can also be broken down by Business vs Consumer.
